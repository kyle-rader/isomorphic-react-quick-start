# An Isomorphic React Quick Start
If you are reading this then you, like me, must be going through the new "I must build a ReactJS app!  Oh wait... what are all these build chains doing?  Now I'm lost" phase.

Fear not.  I spent roughly 30 hours inspecting and trying a plethora of different React starter kits and intro build chain tutorials so that you don't have to.  I decided to take the generic components (pun intended) of my project and make my own starter kit out of them.

## The stack
#### Server Side
* Node
* Express
* ReactJS
* Gulp build chain
* MongoDB (coming soon)

#### Client Side
* JQuery
* ReactJS
* Bootstrap

## Tutorials and blog posts I used heavily.

* [Ben Zhang | Creating an Isomorphic Web Application with ReactJS and Express](https://benzhang.xyz/reactjs/isomorphic/2015/05/02/isomorphic-webapp-react-express-coffee/) <br>
(The basis of this repo)

* [Joseph Furlott | Setting Up a Simple Isomorphic React app](http://jmfurlott.com/tutorial-setting-up-a-simple-isomorphic-react-app/) <br>
How to setup using [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)

* [Egor Smirnov | Browserify, Babelify and ES6](http://egorsmirnov.me/2015/05/25/browserify-babelify-and-es6.html) <br>
Using Browserify with Gulp to do ES6 and JSX transformation with Babelify and create a `bundle.js` single file app.

If you didn't find my setup exactly to your liking, find another, there are many.  Good luck!
